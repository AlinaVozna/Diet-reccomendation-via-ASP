# Diet-recommendations-via-ASP
This repository contains an Answer Set Programming (ASP) model for generating personalized dietary recommendations. The system filters recipes based on user constraints (allergies, dislikes, diet type), assigns one compatible dish per course using choice rules, and computes daily macronutrient totals for nutritional validation.  
All ASP rules are modular and easily extendable, supporting integration with cognitive agents and human–robot interaction scenarios.
